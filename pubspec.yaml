# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #     - family: SFPRO
      
  #          assets/fonts/SFPRODISPLAYBLACKITALIC.OTF
  #          assets/fonts/SFPRODISPLAYBOLD.OTF
  #          assets/fonts/SFPRODISPLAYHEAVYITALIC.OTF
  #          assets/fonts/SFPRODISPLAYLIGHTITALIC.OTF
  #          assets/fonts/SFPRODISPLAYMEDIUM.OTF
  #          assets/fonts/SFPRODISPLAYREGULAR.OTF
  #          assets/fonts/SFPRODISPLAYSEMIBOLDITALIC.OTF
  #          assets/fonts/SFPRODISPLAYTHINITALIC.OTF
  #          assets/fonts/SFPRODISPLAYULTRALIGHTITALIC.OTF
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
